Stablecoin payments infrastructure
What are the use cases for your customers? 
We’re looking at enabling customers to accept stablecoin or collect from third parties and convert it into fiat as and when they want to. As well as enabling them to buy stablecoin using our proprietary platform and pay out in stablecoins as and when required.
From our customers’ perspective, this will be an additional capability they can access via our existing platform in the same way they access fiat payment services.
How did you build a business case for this? 
The genesis of this initiative was our commitment to meeting our customers’ evolving needs. So it really started from customer demand. And of course, we want to be ahead in the race when it comes to offering innovative new payment methods in our space. 
Engaging with companies like BVNK helped us get a deeper insight into industry, the trends, the overall potential and the competitive landscape. We consolidated everything, articulated the rationale to our leadership team, and decided how to move forward.
Does integrating stablecoins harm your relationships with banks?
As the head of banking relationships, that was the first question that came to my mind when we started talking about this proposition!
But actually, because our existing customers are demanding this, if we can offer it, we expect we’re going to significantly increase our volumes. This will help our existing banking providers too, as we’ll likely be processing more flows through them, rather than reducing the numbers.
We've always been transparent with our banking partners, so we’ve been engaging constantly with them on this. Overall banks are quite open and positive. And because we want to implement this in partnership with another good company who already has strong compliance credentials, that helps when we speak to the banks.
Do we think more fintechs will adopt stablecoins as a payment method?
Fintechs have always been at the forefront of innovation. Whenever we talk about any innovation in the financial sector, two factors always come to mind: speed and accessibility. 
On both those fronts, stablecoins and blockchain payments have huge potential, and because of that I think they’ll gain a lot of acceptance going forward.
